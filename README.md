# Android_App1

This application has two buttons COUNT and RESET. When the user taps on the COUNT button the count increases by 1.
The count is maintained in binary and is displayed by radiobuttons on the screen. The count is limited to 7 and therefore the app uses 3 radiobuttons.
When the user taps the RESET button the count is reset.
